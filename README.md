# Edge-Detection-and-Image-Filters
This program takes a filter and image as input and will output the filtered image under the specified name. This contains filters for edge detection, blur, grayscale, reflect, and sepia.
# Usage
To run this program first type "make filter" in the command line to compile the files properly. To execute a filter run "./filter [flag] infile outfile". For example, an image folder is provided so you may test the filters. Try running "./filter -e images/courtyard.bmp out.bmp" to produce the edge filtered image of the courtyard.bmp. Subsequently, use -b for blur, -g for grayscale, -r for relect, and -s for sepia. You may also use any of the other images located in the image folder.
